        There are multiple ways to figure out the app-id of the application as seen by labwc:
        - In the labwc window switcher with a field definition of `identifier`
        - In the labwc debug log output (`labwc -d 2>/tmp/labwc.log` and `grep 'identifier=' /tmp/labwc.log`)
        - Via external tool like `wlrctl window list` (first column)
        - Via external tool like `lswt`
